# Customer-segmentation-problem

Challenge taken from 2020 Maratona Behind the Code from IBM. A bank's dataset was provided with information about its costumers, wich could belong to one of 6 different segments. Unbalanced classes and a relatively high percentage of null values in the dataset were the main difficulties to make the classification task.
